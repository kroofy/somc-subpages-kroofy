somc-subpages-kroofy
====================

Listing subpages of the current page using either a widget or shortcode. Should support any post type that uses hierarchy ordering of pages.

Supports sorting of nodes and child nodes alphabetically as well as expanding/closing nodes using Javascript, so no reloading of the page necessary.

Shows `post_thumbnail` when available. It handles “infinite” child nodes, although 2-3 levels are recommend in terms of usability.

## Usage

Write [somc­-subpages-kroofy] in the WYSIWYG editor of the pages that contains subpages you want to list.

### Widget
Select the ‘Subpages’ widget from the list of widgets and add them to the widgets area you want to use. The active page shows the subpages when available.
